Each user is assigned a role \nwithin an organization / company, depending on which he may or may not \nbe able to perform actions. To specify the organization on which you \nwish to operate, you must provide the custom \n`X-Elorus-Organization` HTTP header:\n\n    X-Elorus-Organization: 128759403567807\n\nSince each API key represents a user, the ability to retrieve, update or \ndelete data **depends on the user role** within the specified organization.\n\nIn the event of an unauthorized request, the Elorus API returns a `HTTP 403` \nresponse. Additional details about the error may be provided within the \nresponse body.\n\nThe use of `X-Elorus-Organization` is explicitly documented where needed,\nunder the *Header Parameters* section. \n\nTo start developing with the Elorus API you need to sign up for a free account.\nThe best way to try out Elorus and test your code is through \n[demo organizations](#tag/Using-the-API). \n",

Demo organizations are a special form of \norganizations, suitable for reviewing \nElorus and experimenting with the API. Within a demo organization:\n\n- You can create unlimited documents to unlimited clients / suppliers.\n- You can only have a single user - yourself.\n- User management & plan subscription functionality is disabled both in \nthe application UI and the API.\n- Data is automatically reset at the 1st of every month.\n\n****\nDemo organizations can be created through the Elorus UI. Contact the [Elorus \nsupport team](mailto:support@elorus.com) for more information.\n****\n\n## Call rate limits\n\nEach user has a hard limit of 1000 API calls per day. \nAt the same time, a user may not perform more than 60 requests \nper minute. If an API call exceeds these limits, you will receive an \n`HTTP 429` response. The accompanying error message will look like \n`\"Request was throttled. Expected available in 60.0 seconds\"`.\n\n## Localization\n\n### Language\n\nThe English language is used throughout the Elorus API, regardless \nof the authenticated user's language preference. The English\nlocale conventions are also used for decimal numbers and dates:\n\n- The character `.` is used as a floating point for decimal numbers.\n- Dates are expected & returned in the form of `YYYY-mm-dd`.\n\n### Timezone\nThe UTC timezone is used throughout the Elorus API. \nDatetime values are formatted in the standard ISO format.\n",

The\n`interval` and `period` fields specify the frequency \n(e.g. every 2 weeks) and the `end_datetime` the date on which the\nlast execution will occur. For example, to create a recurring invoice\nthat will start on Jan 1, 2019 and will generate new invoices\nevery month until Jan 1, 2020, the recurring schedule would be:\n\n~~~\nstart_datetime   2019-01-01T10:00:00.0Z\ninterval         1\nperiod           months\nend_datetime     2020-01-01T10:00:00.0Z\n~~~\n\n#### Generated invoices\nAdditional information regarding the generated invoices \n(i.e. the client, invoice lines, appearance settings etc.) is also\nstored on the recurring invoice.
